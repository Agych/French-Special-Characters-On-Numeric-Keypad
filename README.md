# FRENCH SPECIAL CHARACTERS ON NUMERIC KEYPAD.

-------------------------------

Created in AutoHotKey, for Windows 7/8/10.

## Description.

This portable program runs in background/tray and works as follows.

When NumLock is:
- Off, the program prints French special characters + some additional characters.
- On, the numeric characters (0-9) are used, just like on a regular NumPad.  

Example:
